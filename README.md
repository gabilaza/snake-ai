# SnakeAI

## Introduction
The SnakeAI is a computer program. He is learning to play the snake game. For the AI I am using the genetic algorithm.

## Setup
Install python 3.x.

```pip install pygame```

```pip install numpy```

## Usage

The configuration file is config.py (where you can change some variables).

If the humanPlay variable (config.py) is true then the user can play the Snake game. But if the humanPlay variable (config.py) is false then the AI is playing.

To run the computer program, you can use: ```python main.py```
